# Use-Case Descriptions

### Use Case 0
_User sets up telemetry device for the first time._
1. User plugs the telemetry device into a connector on the car’s wiring harness (the connector contains pins for 12 power and ground, 5V power, CAN high and low).

### Use Case 1
_User edits ECU and webapp CAN configurations to transmit/receive data channels._
1. User configures the vehicle's ECU to transmit relevant data over CAN IDs between 0x200-0x300. First time setup should include:
    - Engine coolant temperature
    - Engine speed (RPM)
    - Battery voltage
    - Throttle position
2. User opens the telemetry webapp and opens the CAN ID configuration page from the navbar.
3. User is able to choose a previously created configuration or create a new one.
4. When creating new configuration, user can assign CANID and number of signals incoming from ECU.
    - For each data channel: data channel, start bit, bit length, adder, multiplier, and unit.

Note: All other use cases assume that case 0 and 1 (first time setup) has occurred.

### Use Case 2
_User views live data on default dashboard page._
1. User opens the telemetry webapp, where they see a default dashboard page. It displays "Not Connected", and shows the following default displays (which are visible but empty, as no data is transmitting):
    - A time-series graph of engine coolant temperature
    - A time-series graph of engine speed (RPM)
    - A number for battery voltage
    - A linear gauge for throttle position
2. A driver turns on the car, beginning data transmission, which causes the display to change to “Connected.” The display components populate with live numbers.

### Use Case 3
_User inserts new display components on custom dashboard page._
1. User opens the telemetry webapp to the default dashboard page (Not Connected).
2. User clicks the "Add Row" button. Insert number of components in row.
3. User chooses "+" sign to assign: Component type, CAN ID, data channel, etc.
4. The new component appears on the dashboard.
5. When the page says “Connected,” the new graphs also populate with live data.

### Use Case 4
_User edits existing components on the dashboard._
1. User clicks the settings button on existing component, bringing up the component editor.
2. User changes the data channel. For example, from battery voltage to fuel pressure, and the type of graph from a number to a linear gauge. 
3. User deletes the throttle position display.

### Use Case 5
_Two users view website at the same time._
1. User 1 opens the telemetry webapp to the default dashboard (Not Connected because the car is off).
2. A driver turns the car on, causing User 1’s page to switch to Connected.
3. User 2 opens the telemetry webapp to the default dashboard, and sees Connected since the car is on.
4. User 2 sees the same display as user 1 - live data as well as historical data from earlier in the run.

2. Driver gets into vehicle and ensure the device is turned on.    
3. Crew ensures data is being updated to monitors.    
4. Driver drives.    
5. Engine temperature starts to climb above normal operating range.   
6. Device relays temperature data to the crew.   
7. Device sends alert to driver and crew.

9. Crew discovers a crack in the radiator/coolant leak.   
10. Crew replaces the radiator.   
11. Driver and crew retest.   


## Case 2 
_A crew recently installed a new part and want to make sure the vehicle is running smoothly._
1. Driver installs the device, connects it to the ECU. 
2. Driver drives.
3. Crew monitors horsepower as driver goes around the track.
4. Crew notices an increase in performance.
5. Vehicle is now tested and crew knows part was installed correctly.


## Case 3 
_A driver has been testing a vehicle. As he is driving, he notices some of the electrical components in the vehicle are flickering, a sign of a problematic battery._
1. Driver installs the device, connects it to the ECU. 
2. Driver drives.
3. Driver notices flickering issue.
4. Crew checks battery voltage readings, confirmed to be low.
5. Crew changes battery.
6. Driver retests vehicle.
 

## Case 4 
_Ian Applebaum is a weekend racer. It’s been a few months since he decided to go to the track, but he notices that his acceleration is a bit rough. The engine sounds uneven, potentially indicating that car has a timing issue. This can cause damage to the vehicle, so Ian decides to check his timing. Ian decides to work on it in the garage._
1. Ian installs the device into his vehicle. 
2. Ian opens his computer and accesses the device UI. 
3. Ian test drives his car. 
4. Ian accesses his timing data from the past couple months where there were no issues. 
5. Ian compares it with the most recent, problematic timing data. 
6. Ian attempts to fix problem by using old timing values to replace the new ones. 
7. Ian test drives the vehicle. 
8. The engine performs well and the sound is normal.
9. Ian takes his significant other for a date with the saved labor costs. 

## Case 5
_A driver is racing in Monaco, but there seems to be an issue. He has been driving for some time and notices that his fuel gauge is indicating that it is still full. Knowing that this cannot be correct, he radios his team about the issue._
1. Team installs the device.
2. Crew checks and maintains the vehicle. Everything is OK.
3. After the race starts, no issues are detected for the first 30 minutes.
4. Driver looks at his fuel gauge and notices it is indicating the tank is full. Needle is stuck.
5. Driver radios the pit crew about this issue. 
6. Team cross checks fuel levels with the live data being transmitted.
